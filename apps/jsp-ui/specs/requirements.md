# Joint Survey Processing (JSP) UI Requirements

This document specifies the high-level requirements for the Joint Survey Processing (JSP) UI using the EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) format.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Image Display

- The system shall display astronomical images in standard formats (e.g., FITS, JPEG, PNG) in the main viewer area.
- The system shall allow users to zoom and pan within the displayed image.
- The system shall overlay celestial coordinate grids (e.g., RA/Dec) on the image when requested.

### 2. Data Selection and Loading

- The system shall allow users to select and load images from a list of available datasets.
- The system shall provide a preview of the selected image before loading it into the main viewer.

### 3. Celestial Object Selection

- The system shall allow users to select regions or objects within the image using a selection box or similar tool.
- The system shall display metadata for the selected region or object, including coordinates and brightness.

### 4. Telescope Database Integration

- The system shall provide a list of telescopes and their properties for user selection.
- The system shall allow users to filter available images by telescope.

### 5. Error Handling

- The system shall display user-friendly error messages when image loading or processing fails.

### 6. User Interface

- The system shall provide a responsive and intuitive user interface suitable for both desktop and mobile devices.
- The system shall provide a menu for navigation between major features (e.g., image viewer, telescope selection, settings).

### 7. Settings and Preferences

- The system shall allow users to configure display settings (e.g., color maps, overlays).
- The system shall persist user preferences between sessions.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. Performance

- The system shall load and display images within 2 seconds for standard image sizes (<10MB) on typical hardware.

### 2. Compatibility

- The system shall support the latest versions of major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

### 3. Accessibility

- The system shall comply with WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility guidelines.

### 4. Security

- The system shall prevent unauthorized access to restricted datasets.
